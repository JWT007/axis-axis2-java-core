Apache Axis2 2.0.0 Release Notes
--------------------------------

This release marks the transition to jakarta that has been tested with Tomcat 11
and Wildfly 32, and is expected to support EE 10 and Spring 6 / Spring Boot 3.

The Axis2 project transition to jakarta depends partly on Axiom, which has also been updated to 2.0.0.

The main purpose of the release is to upgrade everything possible to the latest,
and have our Jira issues cleaned up.

The most likely way to get a Jira issue fixed is with a GitHub PR, due to 
the large amount of Axis2 features that are unused by the committers and therefore
difficult to test a fix.

The 2.0.0 release lacks a few features in previous releases because of a lack of 
adequate GitHub PR's.

These missing features include preemptive basic authentication, though there is a work around explained in the Jira issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIS2-6055 .

OSGI support is also missing. The state of its dependency Felix and jakarta is unclear. This feature has code that is difficult to support and lacks GitHub PR's after several attempts
to gain volunteers. We hope to support oSGI again in 2.0.1.

For those interested in Rampart - an optional implementation of WS-Sec* standards that depends on Axis2 - they can expect a Rampart 2.0.0 soon that isn't expected to add much to the recently released Rampart 1.8.0 which is based on the previous Axis2 version, 1.8.2.
