Apache Axis2 1.7.0 Release Note
-------------------------------

### Changes in this release

*   XmlSchema has been upgraded from 1.4.x to 2.2.x and Woden from 1.0M9 to
    1.0M10. This is a backwards incompatible change with respect to Axis2 1.6.x;
    application code that interacts with XmlSchema or Woden needs to be updated
    to support the new versions.

*   Axis2 1.7.0 supports Apache HttpClient 4.x in addition to the no longer
    maintained Commons HttpClient 3.x. To enable the support for HttpClient 4.x, use
    `org.apache.axis2.transport.http.impl.httpclient4.HTTPClient4TransportSender`
    instead of `org.apache.axis2.transport.http.CommonsHTTPTransportSender` in
    `axis2.xml`.

*   The semantics of the `getAttachmentMap()` method in `MessageContext` has
    changed for incoming messages so that they match those for outgoing
    messages (For more details and context, see [AXIS2-5308][]):

    *   For SwA messages, the `Attachments` object on the message context no
        longer contains the root part (as in Axis2 1.6.x), but only attachment
        parts.
    *   For MTOM messages, application code should no longer assume that the
        `Attachments` object is set on the message context and contains all MIME
        parts of the message. Note that as of Axis2 1.7.0, this assumption is
        still true (because the JAX-WS implementation internally relies on this),
        but this will change in a subsequent release.
