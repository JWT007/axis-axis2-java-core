Apache Axis2 1.7.0 Release Note
-------------------------------

### Changes in this release

*   The semantics of the `getAttachmentMap()` method in `MessageContext` has
    changed for incoming messages so that they match those for outgoing
    messages (For more details and context, see [AXIS2-5308][]):

    *   For SwA messages, the `Attachments` object on the message context no
        longer contains the root part (as in Axis2 1.6.x), but only attachment
        parts.
    *   For MTOM messages, application code should no longer assume that the
        `Attachments` object is set on the message context and contains all MIME
        parts of the message. Note that as of Axis2 1.7.0, this assumption is
        still true (because the JAX-WS implementation internally relies on this),
        but this will change in a subsequent release.
