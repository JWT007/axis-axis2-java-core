<h1 align="center">Apache Axis2 JSON with Spring Boot User's Guide</h1>

<p>This guide will help you get started with Axis2 and JSON, using Spring Boot! 
It gives a detailed description on how to write Web services and also
Web service clients via JSON and Curl, how to write a custom login, 
and how to use them in a token based Web service that also helps prevent cross site 
scripting (XSS). 
</p>
<a name="Introduction"></a>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This user guide is written based on the Axis2 Standard Binary
Distribution. The Standard Binary Distribution can be directly <a
href="../download.cgi">downloaded</a> or built using
the Source Distribution. If
you choose the latter, then the <a href="installationguide.html">Installation
Guide</a> will instruct you on how to build Axis2 Standard Binary
Distribution using the source.</p>

<p>The source code for this guide provides a pom.xml for an entire demo application built by maven.
</p>

<p>Please note that Axis2 is an open-source effort. If you feel the code
could use some new features or fixes, please get involved and lend us a hand!
The Axis developer community welcomes your participation.</p>

<p>Let us know what you think! Send your feedback to "<a
href="mailto:java-user@axis.apache.org?subject=[Axis2]">java-user@axis.apache.org</a>".
(Subscription details are available on the <a href="../mail-lists.html">Axis2 site</a>.) Kindly
prefix the subject of the mail with [Axis2].</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>The first two sections of the user guide explain how to write and deploy a
new Web Service using Axis2, and how to write a Web Service client using
Axis2. The next section - <a href="#config"> Configuring Axis2</a> - provides
an introduction to important configuration options in Axis2.

<p>In this (first) section, we will learn how to write and deploy Web
JSON based services using Axis2. All the samples mentioned in this guide are located in
the <b>"samples/userguide/src/springbootdemo"</b> directory of <a
href="../download.cgi">Axis2 standard binary
distribution</a>.</p>

<p>Please deploy the result of the maven build via 'mvn clean install', axis2-json-api.war, into your servlet container and ensure that it installs without any errors.</p>

<h2>Creating a New Web Service</h2>

<p>
Areas out of scope for this guide are the JWT and JWE, since they require 
elliptic curve cryptography. 

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516

DB operations are also out of scope. Very limited credential validation is done. 
The NoOpPasswordEncoder Spring class included in this guide is meant for demos
and testing only. 

This guide provides two JSON based web services, LoginTokenizerService and TestwsService.

The login, if successful, will return a simple token not meant for anything beyond demos.

Axis2 JSON support is via POJO Objects. LoginTokenizerRequest and LoginTokenizerResponse are coded in the LoginTokenizerService as the names would indicate. 

Also provided is a test service, TestwsService. It includes two POJO Objects as would
be expected, TestwsRequest and TestwsResponse. This service attempts to return 
a String with some Javascript, that is HTML encoded by Axis2 and thereby
eliminating the possibility of Javascript running the response.
