<h2>Download Axis2</h2>

<p>Axis2 is distributed in several convenient distribution packages and can
    be installed either as a standalone server or as part of a J2EE compliant
    servlet container. Axis2 is distributed under the Apache License, version
    2.0. This Installation Guide will mainly focus on running Apache Axis2 using
    the Standard Binary Distribution.</p>

<p><a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/download/1_1/download.cgi">Download</a> distribution packages
    of the latest Axis2 release - <a href="../index.html">version 1.1</a>.
    Distribution packages of all versions are available for <a
        href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/download.cgi">download.</a></p>

<p>The Distribution Packages Provided are as follows:</p>

<a name="std-bin" id="std-bin"></a>
<h3>1. Standard Binary Distribution</h3>

<p>This is the complete version of Axis2 and include samples and convenient scripts as
    well. Since WS-Addressing implementation module is engaged in to Axis2, by default, this
    distribution
    will contain addressing.mar. But the other modules that are being developed within Axis2 will
    not be
    included here and are available to be <a href="../modules/index.html">downloaded</a> separately.
</p>

<h3>4. Source Distribution</h3>

<p>This will contain the sources of Axis2 standard distribution, and is
    mainly for the benefit of the advance users. One can generate a binary
    distribution using the source by typing <span class="style1">$maven
dist-standard-bin. </span> You need to set up the Axis2 environment before
    running this command. Step by step details on how to create the binary
    distribution is available in the <a href="#advanced">Advanced</a> section.</p>

<h2>Standalone Installation Using Standard Binary Distribution</h2>

<p>All the required jars are shipped with the standard binary distribution.</p>

<p>Installing Axis2 is merely a matter of <a
        href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/download/1_1/download.cgi">downloading</a> and extracting
    the Standard Binary Distribution and setting the system variables JAVA_HOME and AXIS2_HOME.
    Point JAVA_HOME to the location of
    your JDK, eg. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_02 and AXIS2_HOME to the extracted folder of the
    release.</p>

<p>Let's look at the different scripts available inside the bin folder.</p>

<table>
<tr>
	<td><b>Script Name</b></td>
	<td><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>setenv.bat/sh</td>
	<td>This will set AXIS2_HOME, AXIS2_CLASSPATH and JAVA_HOME variables for the other scripts to run.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>axis2.bat/sh</td>
	<td>This will act like the java command for Axis2. This will set the proper class path, Axis2 repository location and Axis2 confgiuration file (axis2.xml) location for you. <br/>
	This will enable some one to invoke, say for example, WSDLJava like "sh axis2.sh org.apache.axis2.wsdl.WSDL2Java -uri myService.wsdl". If you use this, you are relieved from setting all the above parameters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>axis2server.bat</td>
	<td>This script will start all the listeners listed in conf/axis2.xml file. For example, if you want to start only SimpleHTTPServer, go to conf/axis2.xml and make sure only SimpleHTTPServer is listed as the transport receiver. Then invoking this script will start SimpleHTTPServer. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>java2wsdl.bat/sh and wsdl2java.bat/sh</td>
	<td>The scripts helps you to invoke java2wsdl and wsdl2java tasks, respectively.</td>
</tr>

<h2>Building the WAR File Using Standard Binary Distribution</h2>

<p>The following examples will run you through on how to build the axis2.war
    file which is required to install Apache Axis2 in a J2EE compliant servlet
    container.</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/download/1_1/download.cgi">Download</a> Standard
        Binary Distribution and extract it to your box.</li>
    <li>Locate the webapp directory which resides in your Axis home directory (i.e:- AXIS_HOME/webapp)"</li>
    <li>There is a build.xml file, which can be used to build axis2.war</li>
    <li>Run the following ant target inorder to build axis2.war using <code>ant
        create.war</code></li>
    <li>You can find the generated axis2.war inside dist directory
        (AXIS2_HOME/dist)</li>
</ol>
<a name="servlet_container"></a>
<h2>Installing Axis2 in a Servlet Container</h2>
<p>Which ever the distribution, installing Axis2 in a J2EE compliant servlet
    container is as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/download/1_1/download.cgi">Download</a> Axis2 WAR
        file. (This guide also gives you instructions on how to build axis2.war
        using either the <a href="#build_war">Standard Binary Distribution</a> or <a href="#war">Source
        Distribution</a>.</li>
    <li>Drop the war in the webapps folder of the servlet container. Most
        servlet containers will automatically install war. (some servlet
        containers may require a restart in order to capture the new web
        application. Refer your servlet container documentation for more
        information about this.)</li>
    <li>Once the WAR is successfully installed, test it by pointing the web
        browser to the <strong>http://&lt;host :port&gt;/axis2. </strong>It
        should produce the following page which is the <strong>Axis2 Web
        Application Home Page</strong>.</li>

    <p align="center"><strong><img src="images/clip_image006.jpg"
                                   alt=""></strong></p>
    <li>Use the link "Validate" to ensure that everything is fine and smooth.
        If the validation fails then the war has failed to install properly or
        some essential jars are missing. At such a situation the documentation of
        the particular servlet container should be consulted to find the problem.
        The following page is a successful validation. Note the statement core
        Axis2 libraries are present.</li>
</ol>

<p align="center"><img src="images/happyaxis.jpg"></p>
<a name="upload"></a>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For any Application server specific installation
    information please refer <a href="app_server.html">Application Server
    Specific Configuration Guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Uploading Services</h2>
<ol>
    <p>The Axis2 Web application also provides an interface to upload services.
        Once a service is created according to the service specification as
        described in <a name="userguide.html" target="_blank">User's Guide that jar
        file can be uploaded using the upload page.</a></p>

    <p align="center"><strong><img src="images/clip_image010.jpg"
                                   alt=""></strong></p>

    <p>The uploaded jar files will be stored in the default service directory.
        For Axis2 this will be the &lt;webapps&gt;/axis2/WEB-INF/services
        directory. Once a service is uploaded it will be installed instantly.</p>
    <a name="hot_deployment"></a>
    <p>Since Axis2 supports <strong>hot deployment</strong> one can drop the
        service jar directly through the file system to the above mentioned
        services directory. It will also cause the service to be automatically
        installed without the container being restarted.</p>

    <p>Use the 'Services' link on the Web Application home page to check the
        successful installation of a service. The services and the operations of
        successfully installed services will be displayed in the available services
        page.</p>

    <p align="center"><img src="images/clip_image012.jpg" alt=""></p>

    <p></p>

    <p>If the service has deployment time errors it will list those services as
        faulty services. If you click on the link you can see the deployment fault
        error message(s).</p>

    <p align="center"><img src="images/faultservice.jpg" alt=""></p>

    <p>Deployment time error message</p>

    <p align="center"><strong><img src="images/faultmsg.jpg"
                                   alt=""></strong></p>

    <p></p>

    <p>Axis2 Administration is all about configuring Axis2 at the run time and
        the configuration will be transient. More descriptions are available in <a
            href="webadminguide.html" target="_blank">Axis2 Web Administration
        Guide</a></p>

<h2>Axis2 Source Distribution</h2>
<a name="_Toc96698083"></a>
Using the Source Distribution both brinary files (which is downloadable as the </a><a href="#std-bin">Standard Binary
Distribution</a>) and axis2.war file (which is downloadable as the <a href="#war1">WAR distribution</a>) can be built using maven commands.

<p>Required jar files do not come with the distribution and they will also
    have to be built by running the maven command. Before we go any further it is
    necessary to install <a href="http://maven.apache.org/maven-1.x/"
                            target="_blank">Maven</aandsettheEnvironment.Thenextsectionwillguideyouhowtodojustthat.>
</a></p>

<h3>Setting Up the Environment and Tools</h3>
<a name="maven"></a>

<h4>Maven</h4>

<p>The Axis2 build is based on <a href="http://maven.apache.org/maven-1.x/"
                                  target="_blank">Maven </a>. Hence the only prerequisite to build
    Axis2 from
    source distribution is to have Maven installed. Extensive instruction guides
    are available at the Maven site. This guide however contains the easiest path
    for quick environment setting. Advanced users who wish to know more about
    Maven can visit <a href="http://maven.apache.org/maven-1.x/start/index.html"
                       target="_blank">here </a>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>MS Windows</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Download and run the Windows installer package for Maven.</li>
    <li>Set the 'Environment Variables' ( create system variable MAVEN_HOME and
        edit path. eg: "C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\maven-1.0.2";
        path %MAVEN_HOME%\bin)</li>
    <li>Make sure that system variable JAVA_HOME is set to the location of your
        JDK, eg. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_02</li>
    <li>Run maven --version to verify that it is correctly installed.</li>
</ol>

<p align="center"><img alt="clip_image002 (15K)"
                       src="images/clip_image002.jpg" height="211" width="477"></p>
<ul>
    <li>Unix based OS (Linux etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>The tar ball or the zip archive is the best option. Once the archive is
    downloaded expand it to a directory of choice and set the environment
    variable MAVEN_HOME and add MAVEN_HOME/bin to the path as well. More
    instructions for installing Maven in Unix based operating systems can be
    found <a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation"
             target="_blank">here </a>.</p>

<p>Once maven is properly installed you can start building Axis2.</p>

<p><a href="../faq.html#d4">Maven commands that are frequently used</a> in
    Axis2 are listed on the <a href="../faq.html">FAQs</a> page.</p>
<a name="_Toc96698085"></a>

<h3>Building Binaries and WAR File Using the Source Distribution</h3>

<p>The Source Distribution is available as a zipped archive. All the
    necessary build scripts are included with the source distribution. Once the
    source archive is expanded into a directory of choice, moving to the
    particular directory and running <code>maven</code> command will build the
    Axis2 jar file.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="clip_image004 (43K)" src="images/maven.jpg"><br
        clear="all">
</p>

<p>Once the command completes, the binaries (jar files in this case) can be
    found at a newly created "target" directory.</p>

<p><strong>Note: For the first Maven build (if the maven repository is not
    built first) it will take a while since required jars need to be downloaded.
    However this is a once only process and will not affect any successive
    builds.</strong></p>
<a name="war"></a>

<p><strong></strong>The default maven build will however build only the Axis2
    jar file. To obtain a <strong>WAR (Web Archive)</strong>, <code>maven
    war</code> command should be issued. This will create a complete WAR with the
    name axis2.war inside the target directory.</p>

<p>Once this build step is complete, the binaries are ready to be
    deployed.</p>
