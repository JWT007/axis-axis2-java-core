<h2>Sample Application to Demonstrate the Functionality of Service
Groups</h2>

<p>Service Groups are a brand new concept introduced by Axis2. With Service
Groups, users can group several services together. This concept gives two
main advantages to users.</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Several related sevices can be easily managed and deployed.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Can share information between different services of the same Servie
    Group at run time.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This sample application demonstrate how you can create a service group and
how you can use the functionalities offered by axis2 to share information
between services of the same group at runtime.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
</p>

<p><u>The idea</u></p>

<p style="text-decoration: none">The ides behind the sample is pretty simple.
We have developed a Calculator service group with three services AddService,
SubstractService and MultiplyService. Each service has two operations. For
e.g. AddServices has a 'add' operation and a 'addPrevious' operation.</p>

<p style="text-decoration: none">The 'add' operation is used to add two
integers and produce a result. When a operation is run the result will be
saved in the current ServiceGroupContext which is the Context that has to be
used to share information between services of the same service group.</p>

<p style="text-decoration: none">When the addPrevious operation is run (which
takes a single integer as the parameter) the saved value of the last
operation will be added to the integer valus that comes as a parameter.</p>

<p style="text-decoration: none">You can even call operations of the other
two services. These services can also use the value saved from the previous
operation.</p>

<p style="text-decoration: none">You can use the client class provided to run
this in a interactive manner.</p>

<p><u>How to run the sample</u></p>

<p>Please run axis2 and deploy the provided Calculator.aar service by simply
droping it to the Axis2_webapp/WEB-INF/services directory (see axis user
guide for more details).</p>

<p>Run the run.bat file.</p>

<p>You will see the following screen.</p>

<p>Select 'n' to start a new round.</p>

<br>
</p>

<p>Now select the service. + for AddService, - for SubstractService, * for
MultiplyService. And press enter.</p>

<p>Enter the two parameters.</p>

<p>You will see the result.</p>

<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>Now select the option 'c' to continue the round. Select the operation. You
have to give a single parameter and press enter.</p>

<p>The result will be generated using the entered valus and the result of the
previous operation (which is obtained from the ServiceGroupContext).</p>

<p>You can continue this interactively any number of times.</p>
