===========================
Using the tools source
===========================
Since the source for the tools has a dependency on the eclipse classes. one has to run the
ant build file (create-project.xml) to generate a relevant eclipse project from the source.
[use the ant -f create-project.xml command]
Once the projects are generated (which can be found in the newly created eclipse_project 
directory) they can be opened in the Eclipse PDE for building and editing.

The tool sources are not included in the build

Note - The plugins are specifially for Eclipse version 3.0 and up
