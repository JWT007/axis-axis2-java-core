<h1>Welcome to Apache Axis2 version 1.1.1</h1>

<h3>@TODAY@</h3>

<pre>Just over 1 month since the 1.1 release, we are happy to announce the 
release of Apache Axis2 version 1.1.1.

Downloads are available at:
    http://ws.apache.org/axis2/download.cgi

Apache Axis2 is a complete re-design and re-write of the widely used
Apache Axis engine and is a more efficient, more scalable, more modular
and more XML-oriented Web services framework. It is carefully designed to
support the easy addition of plug-in "modules" that extend its
functionality for features such as security and reliability.

Modules supporting WS-Security/Secure-Conversation (Apache Rampart),
WS-Trust (Apache Rahas), WS-Reliable Messaging (Apache Sandesha2) are already 
avaialable. Modules supporting WS-Eventing (Apache Savan) & WS-Transactions 
(Apache Kandula2) will be available soon after the Apache Axis2 1.1.1 release. 
Please see these projects' own sites for further information.

Major Changes Since 1.1:
- Performance improvements
- Bug fixes

Known Issues and Limitations in 1.1.1 Release:
- Unwrapping of response messages in ADB(coming in 1.2)
- JSR 181/183 Annotation support (coming in 1.2)
- JaxMe and JAXBRI data binding support is experimental
- Simple Axis Server does not support POX/REST
- RPC  Message Receiver does not validate request against the schema (AXIS2-1943)

Apache Axis2 1.1.1 is bug fix release over the Apache Axis2 1.1 which was a 
major new release compared to Axis2 1.0. We are striving for a simple and happy 
first time user experience as well as a satisfying experienced user experience 
with this release. We welcome any and all feedback at:
    axis-user@ws.apache.org (please include "[axis2]" in the subject)
    axis-dev@ws.apache.org (please include "[axis2]" in the subject)
    http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIS2
