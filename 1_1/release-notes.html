<h1>Welcome to Apache Axis2 version 1.1</h1>

<h3>@TODAY@</h3>

<p>After nearly two years of development, we are very proud to announce the
release of Apache Axis2 @axisVersion@</p>

<p><a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2">http://ws.apache.org/axis2</a></p>

<p>Apache Axis2 is a complete re-design and re-write of the widely used
Apache Axis SOAP stack to build on the lessons learnt from Apache Axis.</p>

<p>Apache Axis2 is more efficient, more modular and more XML-oriented than
the older version. It is carefully designed to support the easy addition of
plug-in "modules" that extend its functionality for features such as security
and reliability.</p>

<p>A module supporting WS-Security (Apache Rampart), a module supporting
WS-Reliable Messaging (Apache Sandesha) and a module supporting WS-Eventing
(Savan) will be available soon after the Axis2 @axisVersion@ release.</p>

<p>Apache Axis2 not only supports SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2, but it also has
integrated support for the widely popular REST style of Web services: the
same business logic implementation can offer both a WS-* style interface as
well as a REST style interface simultaneously.</p>

<p>Apache Axis2 is built on Apache AXIOM, a new high performant, pull-based
XML object model.</p>
