<h1>Axis2 Release Notes - Draft</h1>

<h3>October 8th, 2006</h3>

<p>After nearly two years of development, we are very proud to announce the
release of Apache Axis2 1.1</p>

<p><a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2">http://ws.apache.org/axis2</a></p>

<p>Apache Axis2 is a complete re-design and re-write of the widely used 
Apache Axis SOAP stack to build on the lessons learnt from Apache Axis.</p>


<p>Apache Axis2 is more efficient, more modular and more XML-oriented than 
the older version. It is carefully designed to support the easy addition of
 plug-in "modules" that extend its functionality for features such as security and reliability.</p> 

<p>A module supporting WS-Security (Apache Rampart), a module supporting WS-Reliable Messaging (Apache Sandesha) and a module supporting WS-Eventing (Savan) will be available after the Axis2 1.1 release.</p-->

<p>Apache Axis2 not only supports SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2, but it also has
integrated support for the widely popular REST style of Web services: the
same business logic implementation can offer both a WS-* style interface as
well as a REST style interface simultaneously.</p>

<p>Apache Axis2 is built on Apache Axiom, a new high performant, pull-based
XML object model.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Improved, XML-centric client API including full WSDL and policy
  support</li>

</ul>

<h3>Supported Specifications</h3>
<ul>

  <li>Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM), XML Optimized
    Packaging (XOP) and SOAP with Attachments</li>

  <li>JMS</li>
  <li>TCP</li>
</ul>

<h3>Supported Data Bindings</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Axis Data Binding (ADB)</li>
  <li>XMLBeans</li>
  <li>JibX</li>
  <!--li>JaxMe</li-->
</ul>

<h3>Tools</h3>
<ul>
  <li>WSDL2Java: Generate Java stubs and skeletons from a WSDL document.</li>
  <li>Java2WSDL: Generate a WSDL document from a Java class.</li>
  <li>Eclipse Plugin</li>
  <!--li>Intellij Idea Plugins</li-->
  <li>Web application for administering Apache Axis2</li>
</ul>

<h3>Extension Modules</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Apache Rampart: Supporting WS-Security (and soon WS-Policy)</li>
  <li>Apache Sandesha2: Supporting WS-Reliable Messaging</li>
</ul>
(Apache Axis2 comes built in with a module that supports WS-Addressing.)

<!--h2>Known Issues and Limitations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Recursive schemas (A includes B which includes A) may cause
  problems</li>
  <li>JaxMe data binding support is experimental</li>
  <li>Axis2-595: Hot redeployment in Apache Tomcat has problems</li>
  <li>Axis2-666: AddressingSubmissionInHandler does not deserialize EPR
    extensibility attributes and elements</li>
  <li>AXIS2-667: Operation dispatch based on message body has a known
  issue</li>
  <li>Axis Data Binding (ADB) does not cover all of XML Schema; its an 80-20
    design point. Unsupported XML Schema features include: 
    <ol>
      <li>Simple content extension and restriction</li>
      <li>Complex content restriction</li>
      
    </ol>

  <li>No support yet for unwrapping of doc/lit WSDL files (in stub
  generation)</li>
  <li>No support yet for rpc/encoded style WSDL documents (in stub
  generation)</li>
</ul>
<h3>What's new in this release :  TODO</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Spring support</li>
  <li>Complete SOAP with Attachments support</li>
  <li>Many improvements to ADB</li>
  <li>Numerous bug fixes</li>
</ul-->
