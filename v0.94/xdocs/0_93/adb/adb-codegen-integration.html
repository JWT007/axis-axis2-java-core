<h1>ADB Integration With Axis2</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>ADB Integration with Axis2 is simple and straightforward. Given the
extension mechanism of the Axis2 code generator, the obvious choice for the
integrator is to write an extension. The extension that is added to support
ADB is the SimpleDBExtension and can be found in the extensions list of the
codegen-config.properties file</p>

<h2>Things to Remember</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The SimpleDBExtension adds a prefix to the ADB packaging. This prefix
    is curently adb, hence all the ADB generated code will be inside the
    adb.* package. This prefix is used by the ant build file template and any
    change done to this prefix needs to be carefully handled in order to keep
    the ant build intact.</li>
  <li>SimpleDBExtension is made to process requests only when the databinding
    framework is specified as ADB (using the switch -d adb )</li>
</ol>
