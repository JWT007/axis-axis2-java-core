<h1>TCP transport</h1>

<p>Axis2 supports TCP as a transport. Axis2 has support for both send and
receive SOAP Messages via TCP. TCP transports do not have any Application
level Headers and the SOAP Message that sends should be self contained. This
make the interaction fast and simple. Yet the main limitation of the TCP
transport is absence of the request URI, and the Service dispatching should
use a alternative method. There is two main alternatives methods.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use the name space URI of the first child element for the
  dispatching</li>
  <li>Enable the WS-Addressing, in the case of Alpha release, Addressing is
    default</li>
</ol>

<p>When the TCP request is sent, it is users responsibility either to use
addressing or use alternative method.</p>

<h2>How to start the TCPServer</h2>

<p>The TCP server can be started by running the class
org.apache.axis2.transport.tcp.TCPServer with two parameters <a
href="faq.html#b5">repository</a> and port number as argument. This class
needed all the axis dependency jars in the classpath. New Services can be
added in the usual way by droping the archives to repository, read the <a
href="userguide.html">User Guide</a> for more information</p>

<p>Alternatively the TCP Server can be run with tcp-server.bat/ tcp-server.sh
file in the bin directory of the Binary distribution of TCP Server.</p>

<h2>How send SOAP Messages with TCP transport</h2>

<p>The TCP transport can be enabled very easily from the call API, following
code segment demonstrate how it can be done.</p>
<source><pre>OMElement payload = ...

Call call = new Call(serviceContext);
Options options = new Options();
options.setTo(targetEPR);
options.useSeperateListener(false);
call.setClientOptions(options);

OMElement result =
        (OMElement) call.invokeBlocking("operation", payload);
call.close();</pre>
</source>
<p>The tranport that should be invoked is inferred from the targetEPR
(tcp://...) in this case it is TCP and the listener also TCP . Since the
addressing is engage SOAP Message itself contained. Only other option I can
think of is to use the URI of the first child of the SOAP Body to dispatch
the service. The Parameter is of the type <a
href="faq.html#a2">OMElement</a>, the XML representation of Axis2.</p>

<h2>Sample</h2>

<p>Sample for a TCP Client can be found from the
samples/userguide/src/userguide/clients/TCPClient.java in the binary
distribution, this access the same web service explained in the userguide. To
try the client first starts the TCPServer with the same repository used for
the userguide samples. Since sample is already deployed in the repository
while trying the userguide it will be automatically avaliable.</p>

<h2>Advanced Topics</h2>

<p>Axis2 TCP transport has two parts, a transport Listener for receiving the
Messages and transport Sender to send the SOAP Messages. Axis2 installation
has both the components built in to itself  by default. In the axis2.xml
configuration file, two would look like follows.</p>

<p>If the TCP server is started manually this configuration does not take
effect, this affect the transport Listeners starts by Axis2. (e.g. Listener
started by the Complete Async interaction)</p>
<source><pre>&lt;transportReceiver name="tcp" class="org.apache.axis2.transport.tcp.TCPServer"&gt;
    &lt;parameter name="port" locked="false"&gt;6060&lt;/parameter&gt;
&lt;/transportReceiver&gt;</pre>
</source>
<p>Following add the TCPTransport Sender</p>
<source><pre>&lt;transportSender name="tcp" class="org.apache.axis2.transport.tcp.TCPTransportSender"/&gt;</pre>
