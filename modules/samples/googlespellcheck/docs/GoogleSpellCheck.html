<h1>SOAP Based Google Spell Checker</h1>

<h2>Section 1 - Basic Operation</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This sample explains in detail the semantics of the function calls of Axis
Client (Sync/Async) and how you can make use of the Google Web APIs spell
checking service (doSpellingSuggestion). Spell suggestion requests submit a
query to the service and receives in return a suggested spell correction for
the query (if available). Spelling requests are subjected to the same query
string limitations as any other search request. (The input string is limited
to 2048 bytes and 10 individual words.)<br>
</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>In order to use the Google Web APIs you first must register with Google to
receive a license key. You can do this online at <a
href="http://www.google.com/apis/">http://www.google.com/apis/</a> ."Key" is
the essential thing that is required for you to access the
doSpellingSuggestion service. However note that your key will have a limit of
1000 queries per day  . This key can be used to build your own SOAP based
clients as well. For further information <a
href="http://www.google.com/apis/">http://www.google.com/apis/</a>.</p>

<p>The first and the easiest option is downloading the binary distribution
which includes the compiled samples. Scripts are included for starting the
program in either Windows or Unix.</p>

<p>Second option is to build the samples from source. This has to be done
with Maven. All you have to do is go to Modules/Samples and type maven in the
command prompt. This will compile and will build all the jars required and
copy the necessary scripts as well.</p>

<p>Execute the necessary shell scripts / batch files to start the tool.</p>

<h3>Items of the UI</h3>

<p>The Async Mode screen is the default and would show up like this.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="asyncScreen.JPG" width="512" height="384"></p>

<p>If the Mode menu can be used to switch to the Sync Mode</p>

<p><img border="0" src="ModeMenu.JPGgoogleSpellcheck/ModeMenu.JPG" width="190" height="175"></p>

<p>The Sync mode screen looks as follows</p>

<p><img border="0" src="syncScreen.JPGogleSpellcheck/syncScreen.JPG" width="512" height="384"></p>

<p>The Key can be set using the settings menu</p>

<p>The text boxes can be cleared using the clear menu</p>

<p>Finally the help menu will pop up this help screen</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Operations</h3>

<p>Now you can start doing Google spell checker. Even though the tool uses
the default license key it is advisable to obtain a key of your own . If you
have got your own license key, you can set it by Set-&gt;key in the menu bar.
First you should select the type of call (either sync or async)� from the
menu bar. You can see that there are two different GUIs for each call. Its
because logic behind the two calls. When you work with Sync Client you can
type the word in the text field given and press the send button to call
Google . Suggested words will be displayed on the bottom� text field. On the
other hand ,the async client behaves differently. You can keep typing the
words continuously on the text area and at each press of the enter or the
space key ,a request will be sent and the results will be displayed in few
seconds in next text area. </p>

<h2>Section 2 - Architecture and Advanced Operations</h2>

<h3>Architecture of the code</h3>

<p>Asynchronous Client and Synchronous Client build by the following
classes.<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Suggestion Form-Building the GUI,call the Async Panel and Sync
  Panel</li>
  <li>FormModel-This is the class responsible of sending and receiving SOAP
    envelope callback</li>
  <li>Observer-interface</li>
  <li>AsyncPanel-Building its own GUI, update the receiving string, Handles
    Key events</li>
  <li>SyncPanel-Own GUI sending request according to the mouse click</li>
</ol>

<p></p>

<p><br>
The main method is inside the SuggessionForm class. It creates objects of
AsyncPanel and SyncPanel. setSyncPanel and setAsyncPanel method call to the
GUI to display the appropriate GUI. After that, the program is running
according to the selected (events fired by the GUI) call (Async/Sync) .
KeyListner in the AsyncPanel is listening to the characters typed in the text
area and when it detects a Space or Enter key press, it calls the
doAsyncSpellingSuggestion method and sends requests to the Google Web API.
User can type continuously without any interruption. When the response
arrives the oncomplete method of the callback is invoked which in turn
updates the text area� . In the response SOAP body, the suggested text� is
returned. This is extracted and displayed on the text area. The call to the
Google web API from the Async Client is done by the </p>

<p><br>
<font
face="Courier New">call.invokeNonBlocking("doGoogleSpellingSugg",requestElement,new
GoogleCallBack(word));</font></p>

<p><br>
requestElement � is an Element that holds the request soap envelope. <br>
</p>

<p><br>
In non blocking API client, the client will not hang until the operation
completes ,on the other hand it needs a callback mechanism to get the
responses (if any) for a service invocation. To get this response client has
to register a call back with the SOAP engine. When the response is received ,
SOAPEngine calls the onComplete(AsyncResult) of the call back object.<br>
<br>
On the other hand with the SyncClient the main difference is after typing a
word there is a button to be pressed which sends a call to the Google Web
API. This call is done in a synchronized manner using the
invokeBlocking("doGoogleSpellingSugg",requestElement) statement.<br>
<br>
In a blocking client API , the client will keep blocking till it gets the
response (if any) from the service. This is the preferred method when
invoking web services that do not take long time to complete and the hanging
in the client side is negligible. This will be a huge drawback in the client
side performance, if the operation takes considerable amount of time where
the asynchronous capability will be useful.</p>

<p>�The request SOAP message is built at the FormModel class. According to
the Google Web API WSDL file, required namespaces are selected and attached
to the envelope. We don't have to include anything in the header. The name of
the first child element of the body should be operation name and it should be
namespace qualified. We also have to include the binding namespace to this
element. Here, it is attached as an attribute to that element, </p>

<p><br>
<font face="Courier New">OMElement method =
omfactory.createOMElement("doSpellingSuggestion", opN);<br>
method.addAttribute("soapenv:encodingStyle","http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/",null);</font><br>
<br>
You can find a sample SOAP response message from the toolkit that you
download from the Google Web API page. To get the suggested text first take
the body of the SOAP Envelop. In the SOAP Envelop there are two
elements(doSpellingSuggestionResponse, return) but we only want one of them
that is �return� element. Then acquire the text of the return �element�. That
is the �suggested string� from Google.!!<br>

<p><font face="Courier New">QName qName1 = new QName("urn:GoogleSearch",
"doSpellingSuggestionResponse");<br>
QName qName2 = new QName("urn:GoogleSearch", "return");<br>
SOAPBody body = responseEnvelope.getBody(); <br>
OMElement val =
body.getFirstChildWithName(qName1).getFirstChildWithName(qName2);<br>
String sugestion = val.getText();</font><br>
