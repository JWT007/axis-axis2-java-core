This package will be used to represent the data that is output as a result of MetaDataQuery 
functionality. The output should be similar to the input, a collection of WSMService objects. 
The WSMService objects will represent the merged data from both wsdl and annotations, if both 
were present. The user will then write generators, similar to the WSM convention, that make use 
of the data in the appropriate fashion.
