<h1>Welcome to Apache Axis2</h1>

<h3>04 May 2006 - Apache Axis2 Version 1.0 Released!</h3>

<p>[<a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/download.cgi">Download 1.0</a>]</p>

<p>Apache Axis2 is a complete re-design and re-write of the widely used 
Apache Axis SOAP stack to build on the lessons learnt from Apache Axis.</p>


<p>Apache Axis2 is more efficient, more modular and more XML-oriented than 
the older version. It is carefully designed to support the easy addition of
 plug-in "modules" that extend its functionality for features such as security and reliability.</p> 
 
<p>Apache Axis2 not only supports SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2, but it also has
integrated support for the widely popular REST style of Web services: the
same business logic implementation can offer both a WS-* style interface as
well as a REST style interface simultaneously.</p>
