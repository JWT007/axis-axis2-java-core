<h1>Axis2 Databinding Framework</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The objective of the Axis2Databinding framework is to provide a
lightweight and simple schema compiler/ Java bean generator for Axis2. By no
means it's to be a fully functional schema compiler like XMLBeans. This
document aims to provide the architectural overview of the Axis2 Databinding
Framework (referred to as ADB from here onwards) and be a guide to anyone who
wants to use and modify ADB. Note that ADB is written in a fashion that
allows it to be used as a standalone schema compiler and also to be extended
to generate code for other languages.</p>

<h2>Architectural Overview</h2>

<p>ADB is built on a modular architecture that allows it to utilize a pre
configured writer depending on the configuration.The 'big block diagram' for
the code generators architecture is depicted below</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;picture&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>ADB utilizes the WS-commons XmlSchema library for reading the Schema. The
object model for the schema comes in the form of a XmlSchema object. The
schema compiler keeps an instance of the writer (in the default case it's the
JavaBeanWriter) which actually writes the classes. The writers may use
whatever the technique they prefer, as in the case of the JavaBeanWriter,
they use an XSLT template. The SchemaCompiler also uses a typemapper object
that tells it what classnames to be used for the QNames that it encounters.
This type mapper is also part of the configuration and the users can override
the default type mapper by overriding the property setting.</p>

<h2>Code and Dependencies</h2>

<p>As explained in the previous section, the schema compiler depends on the
WS-Commons XmlSchema library. The XSLT transformations are dependent on the
JVM's DOMimplementation (either crimson or xerces) which means that the
underlying JVM should be 1.4 or higher. Apart from that ADB has no special
dependencies on any other special jar files. The code for the schema compiler
is completely in the org.apache.axis2.databinding.schema.* package. This
package resides in the codegen module of the Axis2 source tree.</p>

<p>Following are the important classes and files</p>
<ol>
  <li>SchemaCompiler - The work horse that really compiles the schema into
    classes.</li>
  <li>BeanWriter - BeanWriter represents the kind of interface the
    SchemaCompiler accepts as a writer. The writer needs to handle the actual
    writing of the clasess</li>
  <li>JavaBeanWriter - The default implementation of the BeanWriter
  interface.</li>
  <li>TypeMap - represents the interface that the schema compiler looks
    towards to find classes</li>
  <li>JavaTypeMap - the default implementation of the TypeMap</li>
  <li>BeanTemplate.xsl - the XSLtemplate the JavaBeanWriter uses.</li>
  <li>Schema-compile.properties - The property file for the schema
  compiler</li>
</ol>

<p>The easiest way to obtain the ADB binaries is to run the maven build for
the codegen module. This will generate the codegen-{$version}.jar inside the
target folder which is directly usable when the ADB schema compiler is
required.</p>

<h2>Invoking the ADB Code Generator</h2>

<h3>As a standalone schema compiler</h3>

<p>ADB comes with a mainclass XSD2Java that allows the schemas to be compiled
just by giving the schema file reference.This main class is pretty much
primitive and does not provide much control over the code generation process.
This is bound to improve in the near future.</p>

<p>Code generator accepts the follwing parameters</p>
<ol>
  <li>The Schema file name - This should be a complete file name pointing to
    the local file system</li>
  <li>The output folder name - This should be the name of a folder within the
    local fileSystem</li>
</ol>

<p>Since the main class has no validations built in, the compiler is likely
to cough up an unexpected error message if these parameters are not supplied
properly.</p>

<h3>Through the API</h3>

<p>This is the only way to harness the full potential of the schema compiler.
The current Axis2 integration of ADB happens through this API. The most
important classes and methods of the Schema compiler are as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li>SchemaCompiler - Constructor
    <p>The constructor of the schema compiler expects a CompilerOptions
    object. This compilerOptions object is more of a holder for the
    parameters that are passed to the SchemaCompiler. The only mandatory
    parameter in the CompilerOptions is the output directory</p>
  </li>
  <li>SchemaCompiler - Compile(XMLSchema schema)
    <p>The compile method to call for a single schema. The expected object is
    a XMLSchema which is part of the XmlSchema library.</p>
  </li>
  <li>SchemaCompiler - Compile(List schemaList)
    <p>Similar to the previous method but accepts a list of schemas instead
    of one.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Deep into the Generated Code</h2>

<p>When the schema compiler is invoked (oneway or another) it generates code
depending on the following rules</p>
<ol>
  <li>All named complex types become bean classes. Any attribute or element
    encapsulated in this complex type will become a field in the generated
    class. Note that the support for constructs other than the sequence and
    all is not yet implemented.</li>
  <li>All top level elements become classes. This is rather a questioning
    feature but unless classes are generated for the top level elements the
    handling of elements become difficult and messy!</li>
</ol>

<p>Once the code is generated according to the rules it looks like the
following. Consider the follwing piece of schema</p>
<pre>&lt;schema xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
xmlns:tns="http://soapinterop.org/types" targetNamespace="http://soapinterop.org/types"&gt;
&lt;import namespace="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/"/&gt;
&lt;complexType name="SOAPStruct"&gt;
&lt;sequence&gt;
&lt;element name="varString" type="xsd:string"/&gt;
&lt;element name="varInt" type="xsd:int"/&gt;
&lt;element name="varFloat" type="xsd:float"/&gt;
&lt;/sequence&gt;
&lt;/complexType&gt;
&lt;element name="myElement" type="tns:SOAPStruct"/&gt;
&lt;/schema&gt;</pre>

<p>This particular schema generates the following two classes </p>
