<h3>CommonsHTTPTransportSender</h3>

<p>This is the default transport sender that is being used in Server API as
well as Client API. HTTP functionality of the Sender is based on
commons-httpclient-3.0-rc3. In order to acquire the maximum flexibility, this
sender has implemented POST interface and GET interface. This is mainly due
to the fact that Axis2 SOAP stack has the tendency to support REST based
services as well. </p>

<p>Chunking support and KeepAlive support also integrated via the facilities
provided by commons. It has the tendency to support HTTP version 1.0 and 1.1.
As chunking support is only available in HTTP version 1.1, thus, this
distinction in seperating the transport version is important.</p>

<p>Transport Sender sets in the axis2.xml's &lt;transportSender/&gt; element,
and it's being declared as follows,</p>
<pre>&lt;transportSender name="http" class="org.apache.axis2.transport.http.CommonsHTTPTransportSender"&gt;<br>        &lt;parameter name="PROTOCOL" locked="xsd:false"&gt;HTTP/1.1&lt;/parameter&gt;<br>        &lt;parameter name="Transfer-Encoding"&gt;chunked&lt;/parameter&gt;<br>&lt;/transportSender&gt;<br></pre>
<code></code>

<p>Above code snippet shows the complete configuration of the transport
sender. &lt;parameter/&gt; element introduces the additional parameters that
should be compliant with the sender. HTTP PROTOCOL version sets as HTTP/1.0
or HTTP/1.1. Default version is HTTP/1.1. It should be noted that chunking
support is available at HTTP/1.1. Thus, the user should be careful of setting
the "chunked" property only with version 1.1. KeepAlive is default in version
1.1. </p>

<p>These are the only parameters that is available from deployment. Other
parameters such as character encoding style etc, are provided via
MessageContext.</p>
