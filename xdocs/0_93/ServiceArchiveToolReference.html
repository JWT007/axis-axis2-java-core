<h1>Service Archive Wizard - Eclipse Plug-in</h1>
<p>Axis2 comes with a simple service archiver tool. This tool provides easy to use functionality to develop a axis archive or an "aar" file or a "jar" file that can be deployed as a web service to the Axis2. This tool is in the form of 
an Eclipse plug-in and can be downloaded from the downloads section. This document describes how the tool can be used.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
Download the binary version of the plug-in and extract the content of the zip 
file into the Eclipse installation folder. (The plug-in will actually go into 
the plugins directory in the Eclipse installation root). Restarting Eclipse will set 
the plug-in automatically.
</p>
<h2>Operation</h2>
<p>If the plug-in is properly installed you should see a new wizard under the 
&quot;New&quot; section.(use the File -&gt; New -&gt; Other or Ctrl + N ) </p>
<p align="center">

<p>Selecting the wizard and pressing the next button will start the service
generator wizard. Following is the first wizard page.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/tools/service/ServicePage1.jpg" width="500" height="500"></p>
<p>Once the class file folder&nbsp; is given (which should be a folder in the file 
system) the next button will be enabled. Page 2 of the wizard requires you to 
locate the wsdl file. Note that the WSDL file cannot be skipped in this version of the tool</p>
<p align="center">

<p align="center">Select the service.XML file in the next wizard page</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/tools/service/service_page3.JPG" width="500" height="500"></p>
<p>Note that The service XML file can be generated if needed. To proceed
to the service generaion page, check the "generate automatically" checkbox. </p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/tools/service/service_page3_hl.JPG"></p>

<p>If the automatic mode is not selected then the wizard
will directly jump to the library selection page. However if the automatic mode is selected the wizard will show the
following page</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/tools/service/service_page4_plain.JPG" width="500" height="500"></p>
<p>This is a somewhat complicated page. The service name textbox should include the name of the service that you
wish to give this service. 
For the implementation class type in the fully qualified class name and hit the load button to view the operations</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/tools/service/service_page4_load.JPG" ></p>
<p> The loaded operations should be displayed in a table. Once this is displayed you can filter the methods by selecting/deselcting the methods using the checkbox at each row.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/tools/service/service_page4_table.JPG" width="500" height="500"></p>
<p>Further filtering can be achieved by using the "search declared methods" only checkbox</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/tools/service/service_page4_search_declared.JPG" ></p>
<p>Once the method selection is complete the wizard has enough information to generate a basic services.xml file. If further customization is required, there's no choice but to manually edit it!</p>
<p>The next step is to add the libraries. The library addition page looks like this </p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/tools/service/service_page5.JPG" ></p>
<p>The library name (with full path) can be either typed on the text box or browsed for using the browse button. </p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/tools/service/service_page5_browsed.JPG" ></p>
<p>Hit the Add button to add the library to the list. The added libraries should be displayed in the list box</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/tools/service/service_page5_hl.JPG" ></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/tools/service/service_page5_added.JPG" ></p>
<p>If any library needs to be removed, highlight it in the list and hit remove. Click next to proceed to the last page of the wizard</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/tools/service/service_page5_remove.JPG" ></p>
<p>The last page of the wizard asks for the output location and the output archive name.<p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/tools/service/service_page6.JPG" ></p>
<p>Once all the parameters are filled, hit the finish button to complete the wizard and generate the 
service archive.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/tools/service/success_msg.JPG"></p>
<p> If you see the above message, then you've successfully generated the service archive!  This service archive can be hot deployed to the axis2</p>
<p> The plugin also adds a help document to the Eclipse help system. You should see it if you go to Eclipse help content </p>
