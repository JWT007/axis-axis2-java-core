  <title>Axis2 Installation Guide</title>
</head>

<body lang="en">
<h3><a name="_Toc96698081"></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>Axis 2.0 can be downloaded as a <a href="releases.html">zipped binary </a>
or the <a
href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/webservices/axis2/trunk/?root=Apache-SVN">source
</a>. This section describes how Axis2 can be installed either as a
standalone server or as part of a J2EE compliant servlet container.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc96698082"></a>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>Axis2 requires the Java Runtime Environment to be properly installed.
Axis2 is developed to be run on JRE 1.4 and upwards but it has not been fully
tested with the latest JRE 1.5. Hence it is safe to run Axis2 with Java 1.4.
If the JRE is not already in place it must be installed to proceed further.
For instructions on setting up the JRE in different operating systems, please
visit <a href="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com </a>.</p>

<p>All the required jars are shipped with the binary distribution and if the
source distribution is used, running the maven build will automatically
download the required jars for you.</p>

<p>Following sections describe how each type of distribution needs to be
installed. Since the process with the source distribution is similar to the
binary distribution after building, the first section explains the process of
building Axis2 from source. If you have the binary distribution you can skip
the build sections and directly go to the binary installation section.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc96698083"></a>Building Axis2 from source</h3>

<h4><a name="_Toc96698084"></a>Setting up the Environment and the tools</h4>

<p>The Axis2 build is based on <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven </a>.
Hence the only prerequisite to build Axis2 from source distribution is to
have Maven installed. Even though extensive instruction guides are available
at the Maven site, this guide also contains the easiest path for quick
environment setting. Advanced users who wish to know more about Maven can
visit <a href="http://maven.apache.org/start/index.html">here </a>.</p>

<p>For Windows users the easiest way is to download the windows installer
package. Once the installer package is run, all the necessary environment
variables will be properly set. Once Maven is installed, the success of the
installation can be tested by typing maven version in the command prompt.</p>

<p>  </p>

<p>For Unix/Linux users the tar ball or the zip archive is the best option.
Once the archive is downloaded expand it to a directory of choice and set the
environment variable MAVEN_HOME and add MAVEN_HOME/bin to the path as well.
More instructions for installing Maven in Unix based operating systems can be
found <a href="http://maven.apache.org/start/install.html">here </a>.</p>

<p>Once maven is properly installed it's all that is needed to start building
Axis2.</p>

<h4><a name="_Toc96698085"></a>The Axis2 source distribution</h4>

<p>The <a href="releases.html">source distribution </a> is available as a
zipped archive. All the necessary build scripts are included with the source
distribution. Once the source archive is expanded into a directory of choice,
moving to the particular directory and running maven command will build the
Axis2 jar file.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="clip_image004 (43K)" src="images/maven.jpg"
height="248" width="668"></p>

<p>Once the command completes, the binaries (jar files in this case) can be
found at a newly created "target" directory.</p>

<p><strong>Note  For the first Maven build (if the maven repository is not
built first) it will take a while since required jars need to be downloaded.
However this is a once only process and will not affect any successive
builds.</strong></p>

<p><strong></strong>The default maven build will however build only the Axis2
jar file. To obtain a WAR (Web Archive), "maven war" command should be
issued. This will create a complete WAR with the name axis2.war inside the
target directory.</p>

<p>Once this build step is complete, the binaries are ready to be
deployed.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc96698086"></a>Installing Axis2 in a Servlet container</h3>

<p>Installation of the WAR is quite simple. It's a matter of dropping the war
in the webapps folders and most servlet containers will automatically install
the war. However some servlet containers may require a restart in order to
capture the new web application. Please refer your servlet container
documentation for more information about this.</p>

<p>Once the WAR is successfully installed it can be tested by pointing the
web browser to the <strong>http:// &lt;host :port&gt;/ axis2. </strong>It
should produce the following page.</p>

<p align="center"><strong><img src="images/clip_image006.jpg"></strong></p>

<p>To ensure that everything is fine and smooth, a probing of the system can
be done through the validate link. If the validation fails then the war has
failed to install properly or some essential jars are missing. At such a
situation the documentation of the particular servlet container should be
consulted to find the problem. The following page is a successful validation.
Note the statement core Axis2 libraries are present.</p>

<p align="center"><strong><img src="images/happyaxis.jpg"></strong></p>

<p>The Axis2 web application also provides an interface to upload services.
Once a service is created according to the service specification as described
in userguide that jar file can be uploaded using the upload page.</p>

<p align="center"><strong><img src="images/clip_image010.jpg"></strong></p>

<p>The uploaded jar files will be stored in the default service directory.
For Axis2 this will be the &lt;webapps&gt;/axis2/WEB-INF/services directory.
Once a service is uploaded it will be instantly installed.</p>

<p>Since Axis2 supports hot deployment one can drop the service jar directly
through the file system to the above mentioned services directory and it will
also cause the service to be automatically installed without the container
being restarted.</p>

<p>To check the successful installation of a service <strong><em>available
services link </em></strong> is provided. The services and the operations of
successfully installed services will be displayed in the available services
page.</p>

<p align="center"><strong><img src="images/clip_image012.jpg"></strong></p>

<p>If the service has deployment time error it will listed out those services
as faulty services. And If you click on the link it will show your the
deployment fault</p>

<p>Axis2 Administration is all about configuring Axis2 at the run time and
the configuration will be transient , and more descriptions are available in
