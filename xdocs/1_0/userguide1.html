<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>Welcome to Axis2, the next generation of Apache Axis!!! This User's Guide
will help you to understand what Axis2 has to offer and how to get started
with it. We hope you will benefit from the power of Axis2.</p>

<h3><a name="Attention">Attention</a></h3>

  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">This User's Guide is written based on
    Axis2 standard binary distribution. (The standard binary distribution can
    be created from the source distribution using the maven goal <code>$maven
    dist-std-bin</code>). Please refer the <a
    href="installationguide.html#Download_Axis2">installation guide</a> for
    further information on the downloadables available in this release.</p>

  <li><p>If you are new to Axis, it's highly recommended that you read <a

<h3><a name="What_is_Axis2_">What is Axis2?</a></h3>

<p>Axis2 is the next generation of Apache Axis. In late August 2004, during
the Axis2 Summit held in Colombo, Sri Lanka, a new architecture for Axis was
introduced which was much more flexible, efficient and configurable. Although
the architecture is new, some of the well established concepts from Axis 1.x
like handlers are preserved in Axis2. Axis2 comes with many new features,
enhancements and industry specification implementations.</p>

<p>After months of continued discussion and coding in this direction, Axis2
now delivers the following key features:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Speed</strong> - Axis2 uses its
    own object model and StAX (Streaming API for XML) parsing to achieve
    significantly greater speed than earlier versions of Apache Axis.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Low memory foot print</strong>-
    Axis2 was designed ground-up keeping low memory foot print in mind.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>AXIOM</strong> - Axis2 comes with
    its own light-weight object model, AXIOM, for message processing which is
    extensible, high performance and developer convenient</p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong><a name="Hot_Deployment">Hot
    Deployment</a></strong> - Axis2 is equipped with the capability of
    deploying Web service &amp; handlers while system is up and running. In
    other words, new services can be added to the system without having to
    shut down server.Drop the required Web service archive into the services
    directory in the repository and deployment model will automatically
    deploy the service and make it available for use.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Asynchronous Web
    Services</strong> - Axis2 now supports asynchronous Web services &amp;
    asynchronous Web services invocation using non-blocking clients and
    transports .</p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>MEP Support</strong> - Axis2 now
    comes handy with the flexibility to support Message Exchange Patterns
    (MEPs) with in-built support for basic MEPs defined in WSDL 2.0.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Flexibility</strong> - The Axis2
    architecture gives the developer complete freedom to insert extensions
    into the engine for custom header processing, system management, or
    <em>anything else you can imagine</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Stability</strong> - Axis2
    defines a set of published interfaces which change relatively slowly
    compared to the rest of Axis.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Component-oriented
    Deployment</strong> - You can easily define reusable networks of Handlers
    to implement common patterns of processing for your applications, or to
    distribute to partners.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Transport Framework</strong> - We
    have a clean and simple abstraction for integrating and using Transports
    (i.e., senders and listeners for SOAP over various protocols such as
    SMTP, FTP, message-oriented middleware, etc), and the core of the engine
    is completely transport-independent.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>WSDL support</strong> - Axis2
    supports the Web Service Description Language, version <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl">1.1</a> and <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl20/">2.0</a>, which allows you to easily
    build stubs to access remote services, and also to automatically export
    machine-readable descriptions of your deployed services from Axis2.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Add-ons</strong> Several Web
    services specifications have been incorporated including <a
    href="http://ws.apache.org/wss4j/" target="_blank">WSS4J</a> for security
    (Apache Rampart), <a href="http://ws.apache.org/sandesha/"
    target="_blank">Sandesha</a> for reliable messaging, <a
    href="http://ws.apache.org/kandula/" target="_blank">Kandula</a> which is
    an encapsulation of WS-Coordination, WS-AtomicTransaction and
    WS-BusinessActivity.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Composition and
    Extensibility</strong> - modules and phases improve support for
    composability and extensibility. Modules supports composability and is
    able to add support for new WS-* specifications in a simple and clean
    manner. They are however not <a href="#Hot_Deployment">hot deployable</a>
    as they change the overall behavior of the system.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We hope you enjoy using Axis2. Please note that this is an open-source
effort. If you feel the code could use some new features or fixes, please get
involved and lend us a hand! The Axis developer community welcomes your
participation.</p>
