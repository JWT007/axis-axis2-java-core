<h2>Code generation IDEA plug-in</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This document explains installation and usage of IDEA code generation
plug-in.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>First download the plug-in link which is a zipped file, and extract that
into plugins directory in IDEA installation directory or plugins directory in
user directory (usre/idea/conf/plugins), if you have correctly extracted the
file you would see a directory called Axis2 and inside there should be only
one directory called lib and bunch of .jar files can be seen inside that.</p>

<p>Next step is to restart IDEA to changes to be taken place , when you
restart IDEA you would see following icons in IDEA if the plug-in has been
installed correctly.</p>

<p><img alt="Figure 1" src="images/idea-icons.jpg"></p>

<p>As well as if you right-click on editor page you would see a link for the
same plug-inform that too.</p>

<p><img alt="Figure2" src="images/idea-popup.jpg"></p>

<p>When you click one of them a window will appear by asking to select one
from two options.</p>

<p><img alt="Figure3" src="images/fig1.jpg"></p>

<p>Click on WSDL2Java codegenaration and click OK to generate code from a
WSDL file.Then the following window will appear.</p>

<p><img alt="Figure4" src="images/fig2.jpg"></p>

<p>To move on to the next page the WSDL file location must be given. The
browse buttoncan be used to easily browse for a file rather than typing the
whole path.</p>

<p>Once the WSDL file is selected, codegen options are to be selected. By far
this is themost important page in this wizard, which determines the
characteristics of the code being generated. Novices need not worry about
these options since the most common options are defaulted, But advanced users
will find it very easy to "turn the knobs" using these options.</p>

<p><img alt="Figure5" src="images/fig18.jpg"></p>

<p></p>

<p>Output language can be Java, C# but we not fully tested C# odegenration
there for it is better to select Java as output language.</p>

<p>Since Axis2 support both synchronous and asynchronous client programming
model , the tool has provide a way to select the options.</p>

<p>Data binding type , the default data binding type is adb (Axis2 data
binding), though the tool is capable of providing XML beans due to class
loading issues in XML beans current implementation only generate code with OM
and adb.</p>

<p>Package name : The package name of the generated code , you can set the
package name that you want.</p>

<p><img alt="Figure6" src="images/fig3.jpg"></p>

<p>To select the output location or the location that the to be generated ,
you do not need to type the output location you can brows and select the
location.</p>

<p><img alt="Fig4" src="images/fig4.jpg"></p>

<p>If everything has gone well you will see output like above.</p>

<h2>IDEA service archive generation plug-in</h2>

<p>First step is to click on Axis2 IDEA plug-in icon and select service
archive creation on that.</p>

<p><img alt="Fig5" src="images/fig5.jpg"></p>

<p>Then a wizard will appear by asking to select archive type</p>

<p><img alt="fig6" src="images/fig6.jpg"></p>

<p>Select archive type : In Axis2 user can deploy single service or service
group so you canselect the service type you want to create.</p>

<p>If you already have services.xml you can skip some of the steps in the
wizard so if youhave services.xml with you click on &ldquo;I already have
services.xml&rdquo; and click on next , ifyou do not have the tool will
create services.xml for you.depending on the option you select there can be
three sub wizards,</p>
<ol>
  <li>Sub wizard 1(create single service and its services.xml)</li>
  <li>Sub wizard 2 (create service group and its services.xml)</li>
  <li>Sub wizard 3 (create service/service group using give services.xml)</li>
</ol>

<p>Option 1 and option 2 follow the same set of steps except some looping
mechanism inthe middle of the wizard.</p>

<h3>Sub wizard 1 &amp; Sub wizard 3</h3>

<p>From the following page you have to select the location of classes
directory , where youcompile output location , you do not need to type it,
you can easily browse and select.</p>

<p><img alt="fig7" src="images/fig7.jpg"></p>

<p>When you click on next button , the page is to select service specific
external librariesand service WSDL file(if you want to add multiple WSDL
files you can do that too , inthe case of service group you can add any
number of WSDL files depending on the services in service group).</p>

<p><img alt="fig8" src="images/fig8.jpg"></p>

<p>Adding libraries first click on small button to browse library file and
then click on Add then the selected file will be appear in the list box.</p>

<p>To add WSDLs first click on small button to select WSDL file and then
click Add button to add the file to the list.</p>

<p><img alt="fig9" src="images/fig9.jpg"></p>

<p>Next page is to select service implementation class (in the case of
service group samepage will be looped to select multiple service
implementation classes).</p>

<p>Step 1:</p>

<p>Select a service implementation class by browsing and the press Load
button to load all the public methods in that class and you can select the
methods that you want to publish.</p>

<p><img alt="fig10" src="images/fig10.jpg"></p>

<p>In service name textbox you can type the name of the service you want ,
but rememberservice name should be across the system.</p>

<p>When you have complete on this particular service press Done (in the first
place if you have selected service group when you press the button then the
following dialog will appear to add some more service to service group).</p>

<p><img alt="fig11" src="images/fig11.jpg"></p>

<p>If you press yes , you have to follow the same procedure to add some other
service toservice group.</p>

<p>If you press No you can , Next button will be enabled and you can go to
next page.</p>

<p>Note from this onward the steps are similar to all the sub wizards.</p>

<p><img alt="fig12" src="images/fig12.jpg"></p>

<p>This page displays the servics.xml file (either you given one in the case
of &ldquo;I already haveservices.xml&rdquo; or the system generated one for
you.)</p>

<p>This page can editable and provide a way to add parameters and module
references to any level.</p>

<p>Note : When you click on one of those button remember corresponding texts
will beadded to the current mouse position. Therefor click on the location
you want to add the parameter and then press the button . If you click on the
parameter button a window willappear asking to give parameter name and
parameter value.</p>

<p><img alt="fig13" src="images/fig13.jpg"></p>

<p>Or you can manually add parameters to any where in the document as you
wish.</p>

<p>Adding module references can be done by clicking on +ModuleRef button in
the windowyou have to type the name of the module to be engaged.</p>

<p><img alt="fig14" src="images/fig14.jpg"></p>

<p>When you complete press the Next button to go to final stage.</p>

<p><img alt="fig15" src="images/fig15.jpg"></p>

<p>Next step is to select output location , the location output archive file
should be created.</p>

<p>In the Archive Name just type the name of the archive file you want to put
and that willfinally become the service group name.</p>

<p>Note : Do not include file extension name when you write archive name we
will createthat for you.</p>

<p>When you are done click the Finish button , if everything has gone well
you will see following message.</p>

<p><img alt="fig16" src="images/fig16.jpg"></p>

<h3>Sub wizard 2</h3>

<p>In the case of services.xml is already available , the steps look like as
follows,</p>

<p><img alt="fig17" src="images/fig17.jpg"></p>

<p>This page is to select both location of services.xml and the location of
classes directory,you can press select button and browse the file system to
find required document andlocation.</p>

<p>If we click on Next button then the procedure is same as above, in next
page provide a way to edit services.xml as mentioned earlier.</p>
