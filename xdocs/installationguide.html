<p>You can <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/download.cgi">download</a>
Axis2 as a zipped binary, WAR or the <a
href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/webservices/axis2/trunk/?root=Apache-SVN">source</a>
depending on your requirements.</p>

<p>Latest release Axis2 version 0.93</p>

<p>All the required jars are shipped with the binary distribution.</p>

<p>Running the Maven build will automatically download the required jars when
using source distribution.</p>

<p></p>

<h3><a name="_Toc96698083"></a>Setting up the Environment and tools</h3>

<h4><a name="_Toc96698084" id="_Toc96698084"></a>Maven</h4>

<p>The Axis2 build is based on <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven </a>.
Hence the only prerequisite to build Axis2 from source distribution is to
have Maven installed. Extensive instruction guides are available at the Maven
site.This guide however contains the easiest path for quick environment
setting. Advanced users who wish to know more about Maven can visit <a
href="http://maven.apache.org/start/index.html">here </a>.</p>

<p>- Windows</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download and run the Windows installer package</li>
  <li>Set the 'Environment Variables' ( create system variable MAVEN_HOME and
    edit path. eg: "C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\maven-2.0.1";
    path %MAVEN_HOME%\bin)</li>
  <li>Make sure that system variable JAVA_HOME is set to the location of your
    JDK, eg. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_02</li>
  <li>Run maven --version to verify that it is correctly installed.</li>
</ol>

<p>.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="clip_image002 (15K)"
src="images/clip_image002.jpg" height="211" width="477"></p>

<p>  - Unix based OS (Linux etc)</p>

<p>The tar ball or the zip archive is the best option. Once the archive is
downloaded expand it to a directory of choice and set the environment
variable MAVEN_HOME and add MAVEN_HOME/bin to the path as well. More
instructions for installing Maven in Unix based operating systems can be
found <a href="http://maven.apache.org/start/install.html">here </a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once maven is properly installed you can start building Axis2.</p>

<h4><a name="_Toc96698085"></a>The Axis2 source distribution</h4>

<p>The <a href="releases.html">source distribution </a> is available as a
zipped archive. All the necessary build scripts are included with the source
distribution. Once the source archive is expanded into a directory of choice,
moving to the particular directory and running maven command will build the
Axis2 jar file.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="clip_image004 (43K)" src="images/maven.jpg"
height="248" width="668"></p>

<p>Once the command completes, the binaries (jar files in this case) can be
found at a newly created "target" directory.</p>

<p><strong>Note: For the first Maven build (if the maven repository is not
built first) it will take a while since required jars need to be downloaded.
However this is a once only process and will not affect any successive
builds.</strong></p>

<p><strong></strong>The default maven build will however build only the Axis2
jar file. To obtain a WAR (Web Archive), "maven war" command should be
issued. This will create a complete WAR with the name axis2.war inside the
target directory.</p>

<p>Once this build step is complete, the binaries are ready to be
deployed.</p>

<p></p>

<h3><a name="_Toc96698086"></a>Installing Axis2 in a Servlet container</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Download Axis2 war file</li>
  <li>Drop the war in the webapps folder. Most servlet containers will
    automatically install war. (some servlet containers may require a restart
    in order to capture the new web application. Refer your servlet container
    documentation for more information about this.)</li>
  <li>Once the WAR is successfully installed, test it by pointing the web
    browser to the <strong>http:// &lt;host :port&gt;/ axis2. </strong>It
    should produce the following page.</li>

  <p align="center"><strong><img src="images/clip_image006.jpg"></strong></p>

  <p></p>
  <li>Use validate link to ensure that everything is fine and smooth. If the
    validation fails then the war has failed to install properly or some
    essential jars are missing. At such a situation the documentation of the
    particular servlet container should be consulted to find the problem. The
    following page is a successful validation. Note the statement core Axis2
    libraries are present.
    <p></p>
  </li>

</ol>

<p></p>

<h4> Uploading services</h4>
<ol>
  <p>The Axis2 web application also provides an interface to upload services.
  Once a service is created according to the service specification as
  described in userguide that jar file can be uploaded using the upload
  page.</p>

  <p align="center"><strong><img src="images/clip_image010.jpg"
  alt=""></strong></p>

  <p>The uploaded jar files will be stored in the default service directory.
  For Axis2 this will be the &lt;webapps&gt;/axis2/WEB-INF/services
  directory. Once a service is uploaded it will be installed instantly.</p>

  <p>Since Axis2 supports hot deployment one can drop the service jar
  directly through the file system to the above mentioned services
  directory.It will also cause the service to be automatically installed
  without the container being restarted.</p>

  <p>Use the <em>available services link</em>to check the successful
  installation of a service. The services and the operations of successfully
  installed services will be displayed in the available services page.</p>

  <p align="center"><strong><img src="images/clip_image012.jpg"
  alt=""></strong></p>

  <p></p>

  <p>If the service has deployment time error it will list out those services
  as faulty services. If you click on the link it will show your deployment
  fault.</p>

  <p align="center"><strong><img src="images/faultservice.jpg"
  alt=""></strong></p>

  <p>Deployment time error message</p>

  <p align="center"><strong><img src="images/faultmsg.jpg"
  alt=""></strong></p>

  <p>  </p>

  <p>  </p>

  <p>Axis2 Administration is all about configuring Axis2 at the run time and
  the configuration will be transient. More descriptions are available in <a
  href="webadminguide.html">Axis2 admin web guide</a></p>
