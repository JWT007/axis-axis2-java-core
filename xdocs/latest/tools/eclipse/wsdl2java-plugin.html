<h1>Code Generator Wizard - eclipse Plug-in</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Axis2 code generator comes built-in with an <a
href="http://www.eclipse.org">eclipse</a> plug-in. This document explains the
usage of this code generator plug-in.</p>

<h2>Operation - WSDL2Java</h2>

<p>If the plug-in is properly installed you should see a new wizard under the
"New" section.(use the File -&gt; New -&gt; Other or Ctrl + N )</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/wsdl2java-screen0.jpg"></p>

<p>Selecting the wizard and pressing the Next button will start the code
generator wizard. Following is the first wizard page.</p>

<p>Selecting the 'Generate Java source code from WSDL file' option and
clicking Next leads to the following page.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/wsdl2java-screen2.jpg"></p>

<p>To move on to the next page the WSDL file location must be given. The
browse button can be used to easily browse for a file rather than typing the
whole path.</p>

<p>Once the WSDL file is selected, codegen options are to be selected. By far
this is the most important page in this wizard, which determines the
characteristics of the code being generated. Novices need not worry about
these options since the most common options are defaulted, But advanced users
will find it very easy to "turn the knobs" using these options.</p>

<p>Once the options are taken care of, only the final step of the code
generation is left. it is the selection of the output file location.</p>

<p>When the output file location is selected, the Finish button will be
enabled. Pressing the finish button will generate the code and a message box
will pop up acknowledging the success. Well Done! You've successfully
completed Axis2 Code generation.</p>

<h2>Operation - Java2WSDL</h2>

<p>Select the option which says generate a WSDL file from the Java file</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/java2wsdl-screen0.jpg"></p>

<p>Selecting that option leade to the next page</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/java2wsdl-screen1.jpg"></p>

<p>In this page one need to select the class to be exposed and the relevant
jar files /classes to be loaded as the classpath. After the libraries has
been set the test classloading must be pushed in order to test whether the
class is loadable. Unless the class loading is successful proceeding to the
next screen is not possible!</p>

<p>Once the classloading is successful the next screen allows the parameters
to be modified</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/java2wsdl-screen2.jpg"></p>

<p>After that the output location and the WSDL file name can be selected</p>

<p>You are now done with generating a WSDL file from a java class and its
that simple!</p>
